# The Titanic challenge
Predict survival of passengers depending on passenger data

# Steps
- [x] build a random classifier and submit to kaggle
- [x] improve it with a simple linear classifier
- [x] revisit data, plot, engineer features
- [x] try a decision tree and other algorithms
- [x] add metrics to compare algos
- [x] add hyperparameter scan for top algos
- [ ] fix and test the use of sparse matrices for 'Pclass' and 'Embarked'
