# Nuclei
Find the nuclei in divergent images to advance medical discovery

## Steps
- [x] load and display image data
- [x] investigate the masks
- [x] clean the image data
- [x] prepare first exploratory submission for first test
- [x] prepare analytic solution ([here](nuclei_analytic.ipynb))
- [x] prepare preliminary solution using a CNN, superimposing the different masks to one ([here](nuclei_cnn.ipynb))
- [ ] optimize this solution, remove simplifications (e.g. several images per batch)
- [ ] use separate masks as labels in a CNN
